Implement rate-limiting and error-handling mechanisms.

Tweet Filtering:

Filter out irrelevant tweets using keyword matching and basic NLP techniques.

Remove duplicate and promotional tweets.

News Summarization:

Combine tweets on the same topic using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means or cosine similarity).

Generate a 50-word summary for each topic using text summarization libraries (e.g., Hugging Face transformers or Gensim).

Database Integration:

Store fetched tweets, summaries, and metadata in a database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL).

Ensure real-time updates by setting up a cron job or Streamlitâ€™s SessionState.

Testing:

Unit tests for text processing and summarization logic.

Functional tests for the user interface.

API tests to ensure smooth integration with Twitter.

Deployment:

Deploy the Streamlit app on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Streamlit Community Cloud).

Configure a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
